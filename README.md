# Bash scripting

A bash script is something that you will encounter quite frequently when you use Linux. You can
think of it as a task automation tool---it allows you to create a single command that executes
multiple commands. It's not just that you can execute a series of commands sequentially. You can do
much more complicated things, using variables, if-else conditionals, etc., similar to what you can
do with a general-purpose programming language. In this assignment, you will learn the basics of
bash scripting.

We will again use a tutorial from [Ryan's Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net). The URL of the
bash script tutorial is [this](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/). Your task is to
finish the tutorial, but there are extra instructions you need to follow.

## Extra instructions

Similar to the command-line interface tutorial, there are activities at the end of each section, and
those are the basis of your grade. However, you need to do slightly-modified activities described
below so we can grade them more easily. Consequently, you do not need to do the activities from the
tutorial itself. Of course, you need to do the activities on this VM using `nvim`. We have
configured our `nvim` so it occasionally takes a snapshot of what you are doing 

### Activities for `2. Variables`

* Create a script named `arguments.sh` which will accept command line arguments and echo out how
  many arguments there are and what the second one is. The format of the output should be the number
  of arguments followed by a single space followed by the second argument. This *must* be your
  format. Otherwise, the grader will fail.

* Create a script named `random.sh` which will print a random word. There is a file containing a
  list of words on your system (usually /usr/share/dict/words or /usr/dict/words). Look at the
  tutorial's activity description for a hint.
