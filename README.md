# Bash scripting

A bash script is something that you will encounter quite frequently when you use Linux. You can think of it as a task automation tool---a bash script allows you to create a single command that combines multiple commands. But it's not just that you can list out a series of commands to execute sequentially. You can create a new command that does much more complicated things, using variables, if-else conditionals, etc., similar to what you can do with a general-purpose programming language. In this assignment, you will learn the basics of bash scripting.

We will again use a tutorial from [Ryan's Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net). The URL of the bash script tutorial is [this](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/). Your task is to finish the tutorials, but there are extra instructions you need to follow.

## Extra instructions

Unlike the command-line interface tutorial, you do not need to record what you do. You still need to do the activities and we will grade based on those. However, we have slightly modified the activities for our grading. Consequently, you do not need to do the activities from the tutorial itself. Instead, you only need to do the activities that we describe here in this document. Of course, you need to use `nvim` on this VM.

### Activities for `2. Variables`

* Create a script named `arguments.sh` which will accept command line arguments and echo out how many arguments there are and what the second one is. The format of the output should be the number of arguments followed by a single space followed by the second argument. This *must* be your format. Otherwise, the grader will fail.

* Create a script named `random.sh` which will print a random word. There is a file containing a list of words on your system (usually /usr/share/dict/words or /usr/dict/words). Look at the tutorial's activity description for a hint.
